# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A3Nest is a comprehensive cross-platform property management application built with .NET 8 MAUI. The application follows Clean Architecture principles with four distinct layers and provides a modern, responsive interface for managing properties, tenants, lease applications, and related business operations. The system supports both desktop and mobile platforms with adaptive navigation and theming capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured Clean Architecture foundation, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows industry best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL have exactly 4 layers: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation
2. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN the system SHALL enforce that Presentation depends on Application, Application depends on Infrastructure, and Domain remains independent
3. WHEN the solution is built THEN all projects SHALL compile successfully with proper project references
4. WHEN examining the Domain layer THEN it SHALL contain no dependencies on other layers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a property manager, I want a comprehensive MAUI presentation layer with multiple pages, so that I can navigate through different aspects of property management efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a DashboardPage as the main entry point
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL provide access to PropertiesPage, TenantsPage, LeaseApplicationsPage, OwnerPortalPage, MessagingPage, CalendarPage, SettingsPage, and GuestViewPage
3. WHEN using desktop devices THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar navigation
4. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display tab-based navigation
5. WHEN switching between pages THEN the navigation SHALL be handled by MAUI Shell

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want reusable UI components and responsive design, so that the interface is consistent and works well across different screen sizes and themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL provide DataGrid, CardWidget, SearchBar, and ModalForm components
2. WHEN the SearchBar is used THEN it SHALL be prepared for Elasticsearch integration
3. WHEN the application is viewed THEN it SHALL support both dark and light themes
4. WHEN the interface is displayed THEN it SHALL be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
5. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL maintain a sleek, modern design aesthetic

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want ViewModels for all pages with proper MVVM implementation, so that the presentation logic is separated from the UI and follows MAUI best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each page is created THEN it SHALL have a corresponding ViewModel
2. WHEN ViewModels are implemented THEN they SHALL contain placeholder properties relevant to their page
3. WHEN ViewModels are created THEN they SHALL include async Load methods for data initialization
4. WHEN ViewModels interact with data THEN they SHALL use dependency injection to access Application layer services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive Application layer with service interfaces and DTOs, so that business logic is properly abstracted and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Application layer is examined THEN it SHALL define IPropertyService, ITenantService, IMessageService, ITaskService, ICalendarService, and IOwnerPortalService interfaces
2. WHEN services are defined THEN they SHALL include methods for CRUD operations
3. WHEN data transfer is needed THEN the system SHALL provide DTOs for all domain entities
4. WHEN business operations are performed THEN they SHALL be structured as Commands and Queries
5. WHEN Application methods are called THEN they SHALL throw NotImplementedException as placeholders

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust Infrastructure layer with EF Core, SignalR, and Elasticsearch integration, so that data persistence, real-time communication, and search capabilities are properly implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL use EF Core DbContext with proper entity relationships
2. WHEN real-time communication is needed THEN the system SHALL provide MessageHub and NotificationHub using SignalR
3. WHEN search functionality is required THEN the system SHALL include Elasticsearch indexer for Property and Tenant entities
4. WHEN repositories are implemented THEN they SHALL implement the corresponding Application layer interfaces
5. WHEN external services are needed THEN the system SHALL provide Email and Push notification adapters
6. WHEN Infrastructure methods are called THEN they SHALL throw NotImplementedException as placeholders

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete Domain layer with entities and value objects, so that the core business logic and data structures are properly defined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Domain layer is examined THEN it SHALL contain User, Role, Property, Unit, Tenant, LeaseApplication, Message, Task, CalendarEvent, and Report entities
2. WHEN entities are defined THEN they SHALL include proper relationships and properties
3. WHEN domain modeling is complete THEN the system SHALL include ValueObjects and Enums as placeholders
4. WHEN Domain entities are used THEN they SHALL be independent of infrastructure concerns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database relationships defined in EF Core, so that data integrity is maintained and queries can be performed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Property entities are queried THEN they SHALL have a one-to-many relationship with Units
2. WHEN Tenant entities are accessed THEN they SHALL have a one-to-many relationship with LeaseApplications
3. WHEN Role entities are used THEN they SHALL have a one-to-many relationship with Users
4. WHEN Message entities are created THEN they SHALL reference Users for both SenderId and ReceiverId
5. WHEN Task entities are managed THEN they SHALL reference Users for AssignedTo relationship
6. WHEN CalendarEvent entities are handled THEN they SHALL reference Users for OwnerId relationship

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured solution with correct project references and NuGet packages, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the solution is created THEN it SHALL include a solution file named A3Nest.Solution.sln
2. WHEN projects are examined THEN each layer SHALL be a separate project with appropriate naming
3. WHEN project references are analyzed THEN they SHALL follow Clean Architecture dependency rules
4. WHEN NuGet packages are reviewed THEN they SHALL include MAUI, EF Core, SignalR, and Elasticsearch.Net/NEST packages
5. WHEN the solution is built THEN all projects SHALL compile without errors

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to run with sample navigation and placeholder content, so that I can see the structure and flow before business logic is implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched THEN it SHALL start successfully and display the main interface
2. WHEN navigation is tested THEN all pages SHALL be accessible and display placeholder content
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL include sample data for navigation testing
4. WHEN branding is displayed THEN it SHALL include placeholder logo and splash screen for A3Nest
5. WHEN UI elements are interacted with THEN buttons and methods SHALL be stubbed but functional for navigation
